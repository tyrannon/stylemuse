# 🚨 CRITICAL ImagePicker Fix Documentation

## Problem
ImagePicker with `allowsMultipleSelection: true` was hanging/not working in Expo Go when called through modal overlays.

## Root Cause
**Modals interfere with ImagePicker in Expo Go!** When ImagePicker is called while a modal is open or recently closed, it hangs and never resolves the promise.

## Solution
**ALWAYS call ImagePicker directly from button press handlers, NEVER through modal overlays.**

### ❌ What Doesn't Work:
```javascript
// DON'T DO THIS - Modal interferes with ImagePicker
const pickImages = () => {
  setShowModal(true); // Opens modal
};

// In modal:
<TouchableOpacity onPress={async () => {
  setShowModal(false);
  const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({...}); // HANGS!
}}>
```

### ✅ What Works:
```javascript
// DO THIS - Direct call from button
const pickImages = async () => {
  const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
    mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
    allowsMultipleSelection: true,
    quality: 1,
    selectionLimit: 10,
  }); // WORKS!
};

// Direct button:
<TouchableOpacity onPress={pickImages}>
```

## Working Configuration
```javascript
const result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
  mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,  // Use deprecated API - it still works
  allowsMultipleSelection: true,                    // Works in development builds
  quality: 1,
  selectionLimit: 10,
});
```

## Notes
- Multiple selection works in development builds, single selection in Expo Go
- Ignore deprecation warnings - the old API still works
- Never use modal overlays with ImagePicker
- Camera integration works fine through overlays/modals

## Fixed In
- Bottom navigation now calls ImagePicker directly
- Removed modal-based photo source selection
- Added direct camera and library buttons

**REMEMBER: No modals + ImagePicker = Success! 🎉**
