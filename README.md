cd stylemuse
npm install
npx expo install expo-location
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
```

**Get your API keys:**

- Start adding clothes and generating outfits! üéâ

## Production Builds & Deployment üöÄ

### EAS Build Setup (Cloud Building)

StyleMuse uses Expo Application Services (EAS) for cloud-based building and deployment. This allows you to build iOS apps without owning a Mac and handles all certificates automatically.

#### Prerequisites for Production
- **Apple Developer Account** ($99/year) for iOS TestFlight
- **Google Play Console** ($25 one-time) for Android testing
- **Expo account** (free at expo.dev)

#### 1. Install EAS CLI
```bash
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
# or use npx if installation fails:
npx @expo/eas-cli@latest --version
```

#### 2. Login and Configure
```bash
eas login
eas build:configure
```

#### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**: Environment variables must be configured in the Expo dashboard for production builds.

1. Go to https://expo.dev/accounts/[your-username]/projects/stylemuse/environment-variables
2. Add these variables with "Plain text" visibility:
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`

#### 4. Build for iOS/Android
```bash
# iOS build (requires Apple Developer account)
eas build --platform ios --profile preview

# Android build
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# Build both platforms
eas build --platform all --profile preview
```

#### 5. Submit to TestFlight/Play Console
```bash
# Submit to Apple TestFlight
eas submit --platform ios

# Submit to Google Play Console (internal testing)
eas submit --platform android
```

### Build Profiles Explained

- **development**: For debugging with dev tools
- **preview**: For TestFlight/Play Console internal testing
- **production**: For App Store/Play Store releases

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### White Screen in TestFlight
**Problem**: App works in Expo Go but shows white screen in TestFlight builds.

**Root Cause**: Environment variables not properly configured for production builds.

**Solution**:
1. Set environment variables in Expo dashboard as "Plain text" (not "Secret")
2. Ensure `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix is used for client-side variables
3. Check that variables are referenced in `eas.json` build profiles

#### Import Errors in Production
**Problem**: App crashes on startup due to import errors in production builds.

**Root Cause**: Error checking in utility files (like `openai.ts`) throwing exceptions before React loads.

**Solution**: Add defensive error handling in utility files:
```javascript
const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY;

// Instead of throwing immediately:
// if (!OPENAI_API_KEY) throw new Error('API key missing');

// Use defensive checking:
if (!OPENAI_API_KEY) {
  console.warn('OpenAI API key not found');
  // Handle gracefully or show user-friendly error
}
```

#### EAS CLI Installation Issues
**Problem**: `npm install -g @expo/eas-cli` fails due to registry issues.

**Solutions**:
1. Use npx: `npx @expo/eas-cli@latest [command]`
2. Try different registry: `npm install --registry https://registry.yarnpkg.com -g @expo/eas-cli`
3. Use Expo web dashboard for builds instead of CLI

## Key Components üß©

### WardrobeUploadScreen.tsx
The main interface featuring:
- Single & bulk image upload
- AI-powered clothing analysis
- Outfit selection mode with visual indicators
- AI outfit generation with animated loading
- Horizontal scrolling wardrobe gallery
- Weather-based outfit suggestions

### utils/openai.ts
AI integration module with key functions:

**`analyzePersonalStyle(base64Image)`**
- Analyzes user's appearance for Style DNA
- Returns styling recommendations while maintaining privacy

**`describeClothingItem(base64Image)`**
- Analyzes clothing photos using GPT-4o Vision
- Returns detailed JSON with title, description, tags, color, material, style, fit
- Enhanced prompts for accurate color and style detection

**`generatePersonalizedOutfitImage(clothingItems, styleDNA)`**
- Creates photorealistic outfit combinations using DALL-E 3
- Personalized to user's Style DNA
- Takes array of clothing item objects
- Returns URL of generated outfit photo

**`generateWeatherBasedOutfit(location, weatherData, wardrobe, styleDNA)`**
- Combines weather data with Style DNA for smart outfit suggestions
- Auto-selects weather-appropriate items from wardrobe
- Ensures complete outfits (not just single weather-appropriate items)

## API Costs üí∞

- **GPT-4o Vision**: ~$0.01 per clothing item analysis
- **DALL-E 3**: ~$0.04 per outfit generation  
- **OpenWeatherMap**: Free tier (1000 calls/month)

Budget accordingly for testing and usage.

## Development Workflow üîÑ

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Test in Expo Go during development
3. Test production build: `eas build --platform ios --profile preview`
4. Submit to TestFlight for beta testing
5. Commit changes: `git commit -m "feat: your feature description"`
6. Push and create PR: `git push origin feature/your-feature`

### Testing Strategy
- **Development**: Use Expo Go for rapid iteration
- **Pre-release**: Use EAS preview builds for TestFlight testing
- **Production**: Use EAS production builds for App Store releases

### Debugging Production Issues
Since TestFlight builds don't connect to Metro bundler:
1. Add UI-based debugging (display status in app interface)
2. Use Expo's remote logging
3. Check iOS crash logs in Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics

## Environment Setup Details üîß

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# .env file (development only)
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key-here
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-weather-key-here
```

### Production Environment Variables
Set these in the Expo dashboard with "Plain text" visibility:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`

**Important Notes:**
- The `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix is required for client-side access
- Never commit your `.env` file to git
- Regenerate your API key if it's ever exposed
- Production builds only use Expo dashboard variables, not local `.env` files

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

### "API Key not found"
- Ensure `.env` file exists in root directory (development)
- Check Expo dashboard environment variables (production)
- Verify variable names use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix
- Restart Expo server after adding environment variables

### "Failed to analyze image"
- Check internet connection
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Image may be too large (Expo compresses automatically)

### Build Failures
- Check build logs in EAS dashboard
- Ensure all required assets exist in `./assets/` folder
- Verify bundle identifier is unique
- Check for dependency conflicts in `package.json`

### "Upload functionality coming soon"
- This button is a placeholder for future cloud storage integration
- Currently all data is stored locally on device
